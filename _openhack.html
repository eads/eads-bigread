        <p>From 2011 to 2014, I ran a weekly workshop to teach fundamental web and data skills by working on real-world data 
        journalism projects. We called the event Open Hack and our loose affiliation of aspiring creators and developers the <a href="http://chitowncoders.org">Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew</a>.</p>

        <p>Our first major project was a <a href="http://github.com/sc3/cookcountyjail">scraper to collect statistics about the Cook County Jail 
        inmate population</a> that launched in November 2012. In March 2014, Maria Zamudio, Sarah Murray, and Brian Peterson published <a href="http://crime-punishment.smartchicagoapps.org/">Crime and Punishment Chicago</a>, a guide to data about the Chicago and Cook County criminal justice system, in collaboration with the Smart Chicago Collaborative.</p>

        <p>In December, 2015, Yana Kunichoff, Brian Peterson, and Geoff Hing published <a href="http://convictions.smartchicagoapps.org/">Convicted in Cook</a>, a deep dive into five years worth of Cook County convictions data.</p>

        <p>Our <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/data-journalism-community-why-and-how-do-we-do-wor/">manifesto was published in Source</a>.</p>
