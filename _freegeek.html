<h1>FreeGeek Chicago</h1>

<p>In 2005, I helped start <a href="http://freegeekchicago.org">FreeGeek Chicago</a>. FreeGeek Chicago is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit community organization that recycles used computers and parts to provide functional computers, education, and job skills training in exchange for community service. I helped write the <a href="https://github.com/freegeekchicago/fgc-docs/blob/master/constitution.md">FreeGeek Constitution</a>, <a href="https://github.com/freegeekchicago/fgc-docs/blob/master/statement_funding.md">Statement on Funding</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/freegeekchicago/fgc-docs/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a>. In 2013, FreeGeek Chicago recycled over 20 tons of electronics and 768 volunteers logged over 22,000 hours.</p>
